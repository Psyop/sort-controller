The Sort Controller is a tool that procedurally populates partitions in passes.

By writing in a simple syntax of "partition = group", you can combine the power
of preceduralism with the stability, flexibility, and all around  brilliant
design of Softimage passes and partitions.

Using the Sort Controller, groups with a naming  convention become a meta data
layer in your  assets that control sorting, and passes become  procedural
rendering systems that will work on  any assets following the same convention,
including assets not yet created. It's flexible  and fast enough for use on
projects of any size,  easily modified, and does not create a strong  dependency
on itself within your passes- at any  point a project can simply stop using it
and  nothing is lost. It's also been aggressively  optimized for speed over the
years, so even  heavy scenes will sort in seconds. Additionally  there is a
check function, which can be used to  check if any pass is unsorted without
changing  anything in the scene.
